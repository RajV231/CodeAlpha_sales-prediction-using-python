# sales-prediction-using-python

This project showcases a complete data science workflow to **predict product sales** based on advertising spend across TV, Radio, and Newspaper. Using **machine learning models**, we explore how businesses can optimize ad budgets to boost their returns.

##  What This Project Includes

- Data Loading and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Performance Evaluation & Visualizations
- Feature Importance & Business Insights
- Real-time Sales Prediction Function

##  Business Use-Case

Businesses often spend lakhs on advertisements but struggle to quantify ROI. This project helps:

- Forecast future sales in â‚¹
- Understand which ad channels impact sales most
- Make informed budgeting decisions

##  Technologies Used

- `Python (Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)`
- `Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting`
- `Feature Engineering + Interaction Terms`

##  Dataset

Ensure you place your dataset as: `sales_prediction.csv`
